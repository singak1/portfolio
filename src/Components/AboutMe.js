            <p>üëãüèΩ Hi! My name is Akashdeep Singh, I go by Akash. I am currently a senior at NJIT in Newark NJ. I dabbled into a lot of 
                concepts and programming languages and I love to always keep my upto date with new techniques and technologies. My passion
                and majority of my focus in spent in web-dev. I love making fast and responsive websites, I love to see my code build up from
                scratch into a fully fleged website. I enjoy the creative process of designing the layout and functionality of a website.
            </p>
            <p>Outside of coding/development, I am a gamer to the heart. I love playing single-player games that have a good storyline to it. If
                asked my favourite game would be hands down Red Dead Redemption 2. Also honorable mention to GTA: San Andreas, hoping to see GTA 6
                come out in my lifetime. I love going on hikes and running as well!
